/**
 * @brief   Fast dynamic interrupt.  
 * @note    Before returning from the interrupt you need to pop 31 and r30, 
 *          since they are pushed on the stack before your vector is executed. 
 *          The order to pop musn't change.
 * 
 *          This interrupt should compile into the following asm.
 * 
 *          push r30
 *          push r31
 *          lds r30,  &isr_vector_table + isr_vect * 2
 *          lds r31,  &isr_vector_table + isr_vect * 2 + 1
 *          ijmp
 * 
 *  Performance:
 *          Cycles: 8
 *          Flash: 14 bytes
